But truth be told, baby barnacles are avid travelers, drifting shell-less about the sea before settling down. Once they find a good rock to affix themselves to, they float free no more. Which begs the question... Do adult acorn barnacles ever look out across the open sea...and long for youthful adventure once more?",

Though it may look like a half-rotten hunk of fruit, the sea pineapple is no plant, shellfish, or even sea slug. It's a tunicate, wot wot...a fancy name for a shallow-water filter feeder with a taste for plankton. It should be noted that the sea pineapple looks like a tadpole when it's young and can still swim about. Alas, its youthful cuteness wears off once it attaches itself for good to a rock. Ah, but let's put insults aside! Sea pineapples are full of water, you sea. And I fear we're asking for a squirt in the eye!",
