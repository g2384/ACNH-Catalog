A noble goal, you might say. But though the deceptive wretches fool some, they do not fool me! I see these bugs for what they are... Monsters, plain and simple! I say, did you know that walking sticks can grow to two feet long?! Imagine running into one! Surely I would faint.",

Surely you've seen what a menace they make of themselves at picnics. 'Tis hardly the worst of it, wot wot! Aggressive predators with venomous stingers, wasps not only hunt and eat other insects... they paralyze their prey, then drag their victims home ALIVE, leaving them for their larva to feed upon. Suddenly a simple sting seems quite tolerable.",

If I must, then allow me to note that the female yellow butterfly can lay up to 600 eggs at a time! Bleech! And their creepy crawly caterpillars just love to chomp on clover plants. A recipe for disaster, I say. Just imagine reaching for a four-leaf clover, only to touch a larva instead! Yuck! The worst of luck!",
